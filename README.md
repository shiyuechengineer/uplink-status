# Meraki [Dashboard API](dashboard.meraki.com/api_docs) script to output uplink information of all devices.

Iterates through all devices, and exports to two CSV files: 
* MX/Z1 networks to collect WAN uplink information
* all other devices (MR, MS, MC, MV) with local uplink info.

Possible statuses:
* Active - active and working WAN port
* Ready - standby but working WAN port, not the preferred WAN port
* Failed - was working at some point but not anymore
* Not connected - nothing was ever connected, no cable plugged in
* For load balancing, both WAN links would show active.
